  unit_price: 550,
  text: "Kopaka is noble and reserved. Upholding his own strict moral code, he strives to be perfect and always “do the right thing”. A fact that often makes him appear a little cold in the eyes of the other Toa. Luckily, Kopaka’s not too solid direction sense helps the heroes remember that, after all, Kopaka is just a Toa like them.",

  title: 'TAHU, UNITER OF FIRE',
  unit_price: 950,
  text: "Tahu is hot-tempered, fierce and brave. He likes to excel and thinks of himself as the most heroic and therefore also the leader of the Toa. At times, this had made him a little unpopular with the other heroes – especially with Kopaka. Fortunately, Tahu seems to be born under a very lucky star, and somehow always seems to come out on top.",

  title: 'LEWA, UNITER OF JUNGLE',
  unit_price: 1550,
  text: "Lewa is a true adventurer, a daredevil and bit of a loner whose reckless manners have often gotten him into trouble. His rebel approach is a double-edged sword that the other Toa have learned to love… and hate. On one hand, Lewa is never boring to be around as he constantly looks for new ways. On the other, these new ways sometimes lead to new trouble!",
